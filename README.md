# Roc Init

Little Roc script that inits a Roc project with either the _basic-cli_ platform or the _basic-webserver_ platform because I don't want to search the templates in the internet all the time.

## Idea

Can we add a simple package link manager to it that lets you select multiple packages and addes them to your project automatically?
